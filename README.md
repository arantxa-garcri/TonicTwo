# 🎛️🎶 TonicTwo

TonicTwo is a modernized continuation of the original project **Supertonic**: a browser-based grid sequencer (“musical boxes”) that lets you build simple note patterns and record the result. ✨🎵

## 🎼 What is it?

A minimal step sequencer with 7 notes (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) 🎹 and 8 steps per bar 🧱. You can toggle steps on the grid ✅, control tempo (BPM) ⏱️, transpose pitch globally 🎚️, and record/export the audio output 🎙️⬇️.

## 🏛️ Origins and academic context (Supertonic, 2019)

**Supertonic** was developed at **Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana (UAM), Unidad Cuajimalpa** 🏫, within the **B.S. in Information Technologies and Systems** 💻, as part of the course **Laboratorio Temático II** 📘, under the guidance of **Prof. Alba R. Núñez Reyes** 👩‍🏫 and **Prof. Wulfrano Arturo Luna** 👨‍🏫. The final documentation is dated **November 26, 2019** 📅.

Its core motivation was to show that music and art are not “outside” computing 💻🎨, and to bring music technology closer to people: creative making can also happen “on a screen” 🖥️✨.

### 👥 Authorship and collaboration

The original Supertonic project was built collaboratively by:
- **Arantxa Garayzar Cristerna** 🧠
- **ANR** 🤝

The documented workflow assigned roles: **ANR** focused on **front-end** development 🧩, while **Arantxa** focused on **back-end** development 🗄️.

## 🎯 Original project goals

General goal: develop a music-technology project at UAM Cuajimalpa 🏫🎶 to give this field a place within Information Technologies and Systems projects 🌐.

Specific goals:
1. Use computational tools for sound handling and creation 🔊🧪.  
2. Bring users closer to music technology 🚪🎵.  
3. Strengthen skills in web application development 🌍🛠️.

## 🧰 Technology and implementation approach (2019)

Development started on the front end using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** 🧱🎨⚙️, with **Tone.js** as the library used to create sounds 🔉, schedule them in time ⏳, and play them in web browsers 🌐🎧.

The project followed **weekly deliveries** 📦📆, learning tools as needed 🧠🔧, and planning features and improvements continuously ♻️. Planning was supported with **ClickUp** ✅, and the documentation references a **12-week** schedule aligned with the academic term 🗓️.

> Database note: the original scope included a MySQL database (`SUPERTONIC`) 🐬 with tables for admin, general users, and comments 💬. In TonicTwo, this component can be omitted if the focus is purely musical and local (no login) 🎹🏠.

## 🧪 Validation and UX findings (2019)

Validation took place on **Monday, November 25, 2019** 📍📅, during a final projects exhibition 🎓. A user unfamiliar with the project tested three tasks: play with the boxes 🎛️, register 📝, and submit a comment 💬.

Notable findings included:
- The grid interaction felt intuitive ✅; however, English note names were confusing for users without musical background 🎼🤔.
- Registration was easy to find 🔎, but the birth-date input was inconvenient for selecting a birth year 🗓️😅; suggestions included larger fields and better space usage 📐.
- Some users pressed play/clear/record almost at random 🎲, likely due to small button text 🔡, plus a few responsive proportion issues 📱.

The original site also included onboarding elements: a carousel introducing the developers 🎠 and a video explaining the page components and usage steps 🎥🧭.

## 🔄 What changes with TonicTwo?

TonicTwo keeps Supertonic’s core idea (making music with a simple grid) 🎶🧩 and prioritizes:
- clearer UI (grouped controls and consistent labels) 🧭,
- obvious recording feedback (REC indicator) 🔴,
- simple-but-musical controls (global transpose) 🎚️,
- more maintainable code (modern Tone.js usage) 🧰✨.

## 🚀 Run it (simple mode)

1. Put these files in the same folder 📁:
   - `index.html` 🧾
   - `style.css` 🎨
   - `app.js` ⚙️
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser 🌐🧡.

Practical tip: if the browser blocks features due to local file policies 🔒, use a simple local server (e.g., VS Code “Live Server”) 🧪🖥️.
